# Brainstorming 2

### App Idea 1: Calorie tracking app
- What: View calorie intake and output by tracking food eaten and calories burned by working out. 
- Who: The app is for people who want to lose weight or gain weight by being able to view their daily calories.
- Why: We are building this app because there aren't great free options for calorie tracking apps in the market and we want to fill that gap.
- Challenges: It may be difficult to start a new application from the ground up with no prior business experience or base of support that can test the application and give improvements to be made. 



### App Idea 2: Social Media Repurposing App
- What: An app that allows you to post something on various social media platforms through one hub.
- Who: This app is used for people who post on social media whether its casually, or for people who do it as a career.
- Why: It helps conserve time spent posting on various apps if you are posting the same thing, and makes it easier to reach a wider crowd.
- Challenges: It may be difficult to access the different endpoints of posting on various apps because not all endpoints are public.
